          <h5>Bitcoin Pi Cylce</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          The Pi Cycle Indicator is a relatively popular tool among bitcoin analysts to identify potential market cycle tops.
          <br><br>
          What is the Pi Cycle Indicator?
          <br><br>
          The Pi Cycle Indicator uses a combination of two moving averages (MA):
          <br><br>
          111-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
          <br>
          350-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) multiplied by 2 (350 SMA * 2)
          <br><br>
          - The indicator suggests a market top when the 111-day SMA crosses above the 350-day SMA (multiplied by 2).
          <br>
          - Historically, this crossover has coincided with the peak of several major Bitcoin bull markets.
          <br><br>
          It is considered more of a statistical metric as it has no theoretical basis, which may have its reason in the psychology of investors and how long they think a bull market can last and when they should sell.
