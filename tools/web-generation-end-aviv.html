          <h5>AVIV Ratio</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
	  The asset value-investor value ratio is the relationship between active capitalization (ActiveCap), which is the BTC that is in motion at a given time, and investors' realized capitalization (InverstorCap).
          <br><br>
	  The investors realized price (InvertorCap) reflects the realized capital (RealizedCap), which is the price at which the BTC have been purchased but discounting what was delivered to the miners.
          <br><br>
	  The AVIV ratio, then, is a way to measure what proportion of the money in Bitcoin is actually in motion (active capitalization) compared to how much money investors have invested in total (realized capitalization).
	  <br>
	  When this ratio is above 250%, it suggests that Bitcoin is overvalued and a recession is likely to begin, as there is a large amount of money in motion relative to the investment made.
	  <br>
	  On the other hand, when the ratio is below 55%, it indicates oversold and an upward trend, since there is relatively little money in movement compared to the investment made, which suggests that there may be interesting investment opportunities.
