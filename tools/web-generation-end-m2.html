        <p> 
	  The M2 Money Stock is a measure of the amount of money available in an economy, which includes various types of liquid assets.
          <br><br>
	  In the graph, the "M2 Money Stock" refers to the US money supply issued by the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data).
          <br><br>
	  M2 includes cash in circulation, demand deposits in financial institutions (such as checking accounts), time deposits in financial institutions, money market funds, and other liquid assets.
          <br><br>
	  The M2 is a metric that economists and economic policy makers use to monitor the amount of money available in the economy and to understand liquidity conditions.
          <br><br>
	  Control of the money supply is a key tool used by central banks to influence economic conditions, such as inflation and economic growth.
          <br><br>
	  The graph shows the growth of M2 by subtracting the value of the current month from the previous month.
