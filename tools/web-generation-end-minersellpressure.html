          <h5>Bitcoin Miner Sell Presure</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          This indicator shows when Bitcoin miners are selling more BTC than usual.
	  <br>
	  It indicates how much bitcoin miners are selling in the last 30 days in relation to the reserves they have.
	  <br><br>
	  It is an indicator proposed by <a href="https://capriole.com/">Capriole</a>, where the mining outputs of the last 30 days are added and divided by the average of the mining reserve of the last 30 days.
	  <br><br>
          The graph shows the positive and negative standard deviation of this metric for the last 200 days and the relevant information is the intersection with these lines.
	  <br>
          When it is high it indicates more selling than usual
	  <br>
          When it is low it indicates less selling than usual
	  <br><br>
          Bitcoin miner sell pressure represents industry stress, excess, and miner capitulation.
