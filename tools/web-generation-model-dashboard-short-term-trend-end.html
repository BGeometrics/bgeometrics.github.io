          <h5>Dashboard Bitcoin Short Term Trend</h5>
	</a>
        <p> 
          These on-chain metrics allow for the analysis of short-term investor behavior and thus detect trends in the price of bitcoin. They are especially useful for anticipating trend changes and validating market movements based on activity within the blockchain.
          <br><br>
	  <b>STH Realized Price</b>
          <br>
          This is the average price of bitcoin that has been moved/spent/bought in the last 155 days.
          <br>
          If the current market price is higher than the realized price, short-term investors are in profit. 
          <br>
	  If the price is below the realized price, they are in loss, which could generate selling pressure in the short term.
          <br>
	  Historically when the STH value has been well below the BTC line they have been good buying times.
          <br><br>
          <b>SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio)</b>
          <br>
          This is the ratio between the current selling price and the buying price of the bitcoin spent.
          <br>
          A SOPR value above 1 indicates that holders are selling at a profit.
          <br>
          A value below 1 indicates that they are selling at a loss.
          <br>
          A SOPR below 1 in downtrends can signal a possible bottom, while values above 1 in uptrends can suggest overbought.
          <br><br>
	  <b>NRPL (Net Realized Profit/Loss)</b> 
          <br>
	  It is measures the net realized profit or loss of all Bitcoin transactions occurring on the network.
          <br>
          When NRPL is positive investors are making profits on the transactions they make. This may indicate that the market is in an optimistic phase.
          <br>
	  When the NRPL is very high, it indicates that there are many sales taking place with high profits, and it is not usually a good time to buy.
          <br>
          When NRPL is negative, it indicates that investors are selling at a loss. This could happen in periods of price correction or bear markets, where investors sell their assets in panic or to minimize their losses.
          <br>
          When the NRPL is very low, it indicates that there are many purchases taking place with high losses, and it is usually a good time to buy.
          <br><br>
          <b>NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit Loss)</b> 
          <br>
	  It is an indicator used to assess the aggregate profitability of all Bitcoin holders in the market. 
          <br>
          It measures the difference between the net unrealized profit or loss of the coins in circulation and helps to identify the prevailing market sentiment (such as optimism, euphoria, anxiety, or capitulation).
          <br><br>
	  <b>MVRV</b>
          <br>
          Represents the current market value of bitcoin divided by its purchase value.
          <br>
          It reflects the potential profitability of investors today.
          <br><br>
	  <b>VDD (Value Days Destroyed)</b>
          <br>
          These are the days of coins destroyed, a velocity of spending indicator where extra weighting is given to coins that have not moved on-chain for longer periods of time by the price of BTC.
          <br>
          How many days on average have passed since the bitcoins being spent were idle in an address.
          <br>
          If there is a significant increase in VDD, it means that long-term holders are selling their bitcoin, which could indicate a correction. If VDD is low, it suggests that long-term holders are holding their coins.
          <br><br>
	  <b>Funding Rate</b>
          <br>
          The rates paid between traders in perpetual futures markets.
          <br>
          A positive funding rate means that traders who are long are paying those who are short, indicating optimism in the market.
          <br>
	  If it is negative, it suggests the opposite.
          <br><br>
	  <b>Miner sell pressure</b>
          <br>
          Indicates the amount of Bitcoin that miners are selling on the market.
          <br>
          Since miners generate revenue in Bitcoin by securing the network, they eventually need to sell some of their Bitcoin to cover operational costs, such as electricity and equipment.
          <br>
          An increase or decrease in this selling pressure can influence the price of Bitcoin, especially in the short term.
          <br>
	  When it is high, it indicates more sales than usual in relation to the reservations they have.
          <br>
          When it is low, it indicates fewer sales than usual in relation to their reservations.
          <br><br>
	  <b>Puell Multiple</b> 
          <br>
	  It is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins (in USD) by the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance value.
