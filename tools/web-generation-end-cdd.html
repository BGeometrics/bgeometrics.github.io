          <h5>Bitcoin Coin Days Destroyed</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          Also known as Bitcoin Days Destroyed (BDD) is a metric that offers information that can be instrumental in forecasting bullish market periods.
          <br>This metric aims to quantify Bitcoin activity by merging the number of coins moved and the time they have remained inactive. 
          <br>In essence, CDD measures the depletion of "coin days" with each transaction, operating under the premise that the longer coins remain idle, the greater their value in terms of accumulated "coin days."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Coin Days Destroyed calculation involves multiplying two key components: the number of bitcoins being transferred (coins moved) and the number of days these coins have been idle prior to the transaction.
          <br>This process provides a nuanced understanding of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, reflecting the dynamics between transaction volume and the temporal aspect of currency downtime.

        <h4>CDD Terminal Adjusted</h4>
        <p>
          An improvement to this metric involves introducing a weighting factor based on the relationship between the current supply of bitcoins in circulation (CurrentSupply) and the maximum potential supply of BTC (TotalSupply).
          <br>This adjustment is further refined by applying a 90-day moving average (90-day MA) to both CurrentSupply and TotalSupply.
          <br>The addition of the 90-day moving average serves a dual purpose: it smoothes out daily fluctuations and accentuates long-term trends, culminating in the BDD terminal-adjusted 90-day MA indicator.
        </p>
        <p>
          By incorporating this weighted approach, the Coin Days Destroyed metric becomes more robust and reflects sustained trends in Bitcoin activity.
          <br>The BDD Terminal Adjusted 90-Day MA Indicator is valuable in discerning overall market dynamics, allowing analysts and investors to gain deeper insight into cryptocurrency behavior.
          <br>This sophisticated metric thus becomes a valuable tool for anticipating the peak of bullish periods, contributing to a more informed decision-making process within the dynamic realm of Bitcoin investment.
