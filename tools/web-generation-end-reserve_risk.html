          <h5>Bitcoin Reserve Risk</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          It indicates the relationship of the price of bitcoin to the confidence that long-term BTC holders have at a given point in time.
          <br><br>
          Reserve Risk = Current Price of Bitcoin / Cumulative Opportunity Cost (HODL Bank)
          <br><br>
          When confidence is high and the price is low (green zone), there is an attractive risk/reward ratio to invest in bitcoin at that time.
          <br><br>
          When confidence is low and the price is high (red zone), the risk/reward ratio is not interesting. 
          <br>
	  Investing in Bitcoin during periods when reserve risk is in the green zone has produced outsized returns over time.

          VOCDD: Value of Coin (Days) Destroyed
          <br>
          MVOCDD: Median Value of Coin (Days) Destroyed
	  <br><br>
	  When VOCDD and MVOCDD exceed the price of BTC, it usually indicates profit-taking by long-term investors and may mean a possible price pullback.

          Bitcoin Reserve Risk A metric that assesses the risk/reward of holding Bitcoin at a given price level relative to the confidence of long-term holders.
          <br><br>
          Hodler Confidence: Measures the confidence of long-term Bitcoin holders (HODLers) by looking at the aggregate behavior of investors who have held Bitcoin for a significant period without selling. If HODLers do not move their coins much, it indicates high confidence.
          <br><br>
          Price Incentive: This is the incentive or pressure to sell Bitcoin based on its current price relative to historical levels. As the price increases, the incentive to sell typically increases.
          <br><br>
          When Reserve Risk is low, it suggests that long-term holders have high confidence and the price is relatively low compared to their confidence level. This indicates an attractive risk/reward ratio, meaning it could be a good time to buy.
          <br><br>
          When Reserve Risk is high, it suggests that long-term holders may be losing confidence, or that the price is high relative to their confidence. This implies a less favorable risk/reward ratio and could indicate an overvalued market, which could be a time to sell or be cautious.
          <br><br>
          Low Reserve Risk (< 0.002): Historically, this has been a good time to accumulate Bitcoin, as long-term holders are showing strong conviction, and the price is relatively low.
          <br><br>
          High Reserve Risk (> 0.02): This suggests a high risk/reward ratio, where the price might be overextended, and selling pressure could increase.
