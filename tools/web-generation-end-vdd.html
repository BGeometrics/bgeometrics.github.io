          <h5>Bitcoin Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
	  Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple is calculated by multiplying Coin Days Destroyed by the price of BTC, giving better comparisons of spending activity over time as the price of bitcoin fluctuates.
	  <br><br>
          Coin Days Destroyed is a spending velocity indicator where additional weighting is given to coins that have not moved on-chain for longer periods of time.
	  <br><br>
          Value Days Destroyed Multiple is calculated by dividing a 30-day average of VDD by a 365-day average to compare short-term spending velocity to an annual average of spending velocity.
	  <br><br>
          High values occur when older coins are being sold, indicating that long-term holders want to take profits and this usually indicates that the bull run is coming to an end.
