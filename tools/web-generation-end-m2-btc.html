          <h5>Bitcoin and Money Supply (M2) by Central Bank </h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          Bitcoin and the Money Supply (M2) are two concepts that are tied to the global monetary system, but represent completely different approaches to how money is managed and distributed.
          <br><br>
          Money Supply (M2): The Traditional Money Supply
          <br><br>
          The M2 Money Supply, or the M2 money supply, is a measure used by central banks to assess the amount of money in circulation within an economy.
          <br>
          It includes:
          <br>
          - M1, which comprises cash and demand deposits (money that is easily accessible for spending).
          <br>
          - Short-term deposits and money market funds.
          <br><br>
          This chart shows each central bank's M2 against the price of BTC.
          <br><br>
