          <h5>Bitcoin Short Term Hodler Realized Price</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          STH Realized Price are investors in the world of Bitcoin who maintain their assets for a period of less than 155 days.
          <br>Unlike long-term 'Hodlers', who intend to hold their cryptocurrencies for extended periods, STHs seek to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations in the market, they are more price sensitive than LTHs.
          <br>The graph shows the market price of BTC and the price at which these investors acquired the bitcoins (Realized Price).
          <br>STH are known for their willingness to enter and exit the Bitcoin market in relatively short periods, based on rapid changes in price.
          <br>Historically, when the STH realized (acquisition) price crosses the market price from above to below, that is, it becomes worth less, it indicates a bullish period, the STH are in profits and causes FOMO and when the cross is from below to above It shows that they are entering a bearish period, they are in losses and there are many sales of BTC.
          <br>In short, the Short Term Hodler in Bitcoin is an active player in the market, taking advantage of short-term profit opportunities while managing the risks associated with cryptocurrency market volatility."
