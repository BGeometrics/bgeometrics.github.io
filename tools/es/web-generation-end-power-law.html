          <h5>Bitcoin Power Law</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          It is a model that attempts to explain historical Bitcoin price trends using a mathematical concept called power law distribution.
	  <br><br>
	  This theory was initially proposed by <a href='https://twitter.com/Giovann35084111)'>@Giovann35084111</a> and what it suggests is that there is a correlation between the price of Bitcoin and the time since its inception.

                <p>
                  This model suggests that the price of Bitcoin follows this mathematical formula where the price increases as a power of time.

                <strong>BTC Power law oscillator:</strong>
		<p>
		  The minimum or floor price is the one predicted by the model multiplied by 0.42. Historically speaking, the minimum price of bitcoin has been 58% below its fair price.
	          <br>This price floor has only failed once: on March 13, 2020, where the price fell below the floor for just a few hours due to the black swan pandemic crash.

                <strong>Important points to consider:</strong>
		<p>
                  The power law is a theoretical model and, like any model, may not perfectly represent reality. The price of Bitcoin is influenced by several factors and future performance could deviate from the historical trend.
                  <br>The power law model is better suited for understanding long-term trends than short-term price movements.

        Overall, the Bitcoin Power Law offers a way to analyze Bitcoin's price history and potentially its long-term trajectory. However, it is essential to remember that this is just a model and that you should consider other factors before making any investment decisions.
