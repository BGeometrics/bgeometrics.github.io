          <h5>Bitcoin RHodl 1m</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          The RHOLD 1-month ratio is a market indicator that takes the ratio between the HODL bands of the realized market cap, the price at which bitcoin was purchased, for one month.
          <br><br>
          When the RHODL ratio starts to approach the red band, it can indicate that the market is overheating, although over time the peaks have been decreasing in height.
          <br><br>
Historically, this has been a good time for investors to take profits in each cycle.
