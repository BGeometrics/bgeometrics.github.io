          <h5>Bitcoin NRPL (Net Realized Profit Loss)</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          This metric is used to measure the net profit or loss of all bitcoin transactions based on the price at which they were bought and sold.
          <br>
          This metric gives insight into overall investor sentiment and behavior by indicating whether bitcoin holders are making a profit or a loss.
          <br><br>
	  <b>The interpretation of net realized profit/loss</b>
	  <br>
          - Positive NRPL: Indicates that most market participants are selling their Bitcoins at a profit.
          <br>
          - Negative NRPL: Suggests that most market participants are selling their Bitcoins at a loss.
          <br>
          - Sharp increases or decreases: Large swings in the NRPL metric can signify potential reversals or continuations in the market trend as they can indicate significant changes in market sentiment.
          <br><br>
	  <b>Investors often use the NRPL metric to:</b>
          <br>
          - Identify potential lows and highs in the market.
          <br>
          - Understand overall market sentiment (is the market overall in profit or loss?)
          <br>
          - Anticipate potential market corrections or rallies based on profit-taking or loss-cutting behavior.
          <br><br>
	  <b>NRPL USD</b> 
          <br>
	  It measures the net dollar value of profit or loss realized by bitcoin holders over a given period.
          <br><br>
	  <b>NRPL BTC</b>
          <br>
	  The total amount of bitcoin sold at a price higher than the price at which it was purchased minus the bitcoin sold at a price lower than the price at which it was purchased.
