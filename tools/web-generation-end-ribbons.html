          <h5>Bitcoin Hash Ribbons</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          The Bitcoin Hash Ribbons indicator follows two moving averages of hashrate, which is the estimated combined processing power that miners dedicate to the network, the 30-day and 60-day moving averages.
	 <br><br>
	This indicator shows periods when some Bitcoin miners are in losses and start shutting down mining machines. These usually occur when the BTC price is low and can present a good opportunity for investors to buy.
	 <br><br>
	This indicator is not good at predicting Bitcoin value lows. Rather, it shows periods when Bitcoin mining rigs shut down due to difficult market conditions, causing hash rates to drop.
	 <br><br>
	The mining difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, approximately every 2 weeks.
	 <br><br>
	The Bitcoin Hash Ribbons indicator uses 30-day and 60-day simple daily moving averages to identify when the hash rate is in a strong downtrend or uptrend.
