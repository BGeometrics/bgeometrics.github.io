          <h5>Bitcoin Long Term Hodler Realized Price</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
	  The realized price of LTH is the average cost of bitcoins that have been moved/spent and that ha<Esc>ve been inactive for a period greater than 155 days.
	  <br><br>LTH Realized Price is an important metric in Bitcoin on-chain analysis, providing information on the average cost at which long-term holders acquired their BTC. Analyzing this data allows us to better understand the psychology of the market and the behavior of long-term investors.
	  <br><br>When the LTH Realized Price is significantly lower than the current market price, it can be interpreted as an indicator that long-term hodlers are in a strong position and have accumulated their assets at earlier times and, presumably, at lower prices. . This phenomenon could suggest a strong base of investors who are less likely to sell in response to daily fluctuations.
	  <br><br>On the other hand, if the LTH Realized Price approaches or exceeds the current market price, it could signal that long-term hodlers are starting to sell or take profits. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as achieving financial goals, portfolio diversification, or simply taking advantage of profits accumulated over a long period.
	  <br><br>It serves to identify possible support and resistance zones based on the "psychological cost" of investors.
It may indicate changes in long-term market sentiment.
