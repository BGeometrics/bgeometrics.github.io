          <h5>Bitcoin Supply in Profit and Loss</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          It is a bitcoin metric that helps measure market sentiment and investor behavior.
	  <br><br>
          This metric measures the amount of BTC that is currently in profit or loss based on the price at which each bitcoin last moved.
	  <br><br>
          Bid in Profit represents the amount of bitcoin whose last moved price (also known as the "realized price") is lower than the current market price. If the current market price is higher than the price at which the bitcoin was last transacted, it is considered to be in profit.
	  <br><br>
          Bid in Loss is the amount of bitcoin whose last moved price is higher than the current market price. If the current market price is lower than the price at which the bitcoin was last transacted, it is considered to be in loss.
	  <br><br>
          The metric is an indicator of market sentiment. A high bid in profit can indicate that many holders are in profit, which could lead to selling pressure as investors look to take their profits. Conversely, a high supply at a loss could suggest a capitulation phase where many holders are underwater and might sell to cut losses.
	  <br><br>
          Investors and traders use this metric to assess potential market moves:
	  <br>
          - High supply at a profit: This could mean that there is potential selling pressure in the future, as investors may decide to take profits.
	  <br>
          - High supply at a loss: This could suggest a potential bottom or consolidation phase, where selling pressure has run dry.

	<strong>The factors that influence the Hash Price:</strong>

            <ul>
              <li>
	        <strong>Bitcoin price</strong>
                <p>
                  As the price of Bitcoin rises, the income in dollar terms for the same amount of Bitcoin mined also rises.
		</p>
              </li>
              <li>
	        <strong>Mining Difficulty</strong>
                <p>
                  The mining difficulty is adjusted approximately every two weeks to ensure that blocks are found approximately every 10 minutes. The higher the difficulty, the more hash power is needed to find blocks, which can reduce the hash price.
		</p>
              </li>
              <li>
	        <strong>Block Rewards</strong>
                <p>
                  These include the fixed reward per mined block (which is halved approximately every four years in an event known as "halving") and the transaction fees included in the block.
		</p>
              </li>
              <li>
	        <strong>Mining Costs</strong>
                <p>
                  Electricity costs, hardware maintenance and other operating costs can affect profitability, although not directly the hash price, they do affect the context in which it is evaluated.
		</p>
              </li>
              <li>
	        <strong>Network Hash Rate</strong>
                  The total amount of hash power that is dedicated to Bitcoin mining across the network affects the difficulty and therefore the revenue per hash unit.
                <p>

	<strong>Importance of Hash Price</strong>

	        <strong>Profitability Evaluation</strong>
                <p>
          	  Helps miners evaluate the profitability of their operations. If the hash price is high, miners can earn more income for the same hash power.
		</p>
              </li>
              <li>
	        <strong>Investment Decisions</strong>
                <p>
                  Influences investment decisions in mining hardware and the expansion of mining operations.
		</p>
              </li>
              <li>
	        <strong>Impact on the Network</strong>
                <p>
                  A low hash price may cause some miners to turn off their equipment, reducing the network hash rate and eventually decreasing the mining difficulty in the next adjustments.
