          <h5>Bitcoin and Choppiness Index (CHOP)</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
         The Choppiness Index (CHOP) is a technical analysis indicator used to determine if a market is trending or trading sideways (no defined trend). 
	 <br><br>
         This indicator does not show the direction of the trend, but rather the level of "churn" or "choppiness" of the market.
	 <br><br>
         The index has a range of values between 0 and 100.
         Values close to 100 indicate that the market is trading sideways (range).
         Values close to 0 suggest that the market is in a strong trend (either bullish or bearish).
	 <br><br>
         A high Choppiness Index suggests that the market is "choppy", meaning there is no clear direction and prices are fluctuating within a range.
         A low Choppiness Index indicates that the market is in a strong trend, with a clear directional movement.
	 <br><br>
	 It was developed by trader E.W. Dreiss.
