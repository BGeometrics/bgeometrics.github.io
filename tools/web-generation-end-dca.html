          <h5>Bitcoin DCA Calculator (Dollar Cost Averaging)</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
          Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) in Bitcoin is a periodic and constant way of investing.
          <br><br>
          This method of investing in BTC is based on distributing the investment into recurring purchases to balance purchases made at high and low prices.
          <br><br>
          DCA is a popular technique among Bitcoin investors because it minimizes market volatility and promotes sustained long-term portfolio growth.
          <br><br>
	  In short, the Bitcoin DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) calculator determines the average cost of Bitcoin over a series of purchases made at regular intervals, regardless of the price at the time of each purchase. This method spreads investment risk over time.
