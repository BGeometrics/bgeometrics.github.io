          <h5>Bitcoin Whales Holdings (1000 to 10000 BTC)</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
	  This chart shows the evolution of Bitcoin holdings in addresses that own between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, commonly referred to as whales. The blue line represents the total amount of bitcoins held by these addresses over time. The black line shows the price of Bitcoin during the same period.
	  <br><br>
	  At the bottom, the purple bar chart displays the daily bitcoin flow (inflows or outflows) for these addresses, expressed as a percentage. Positive values indicate accumulation (buying), while negative values indicate distribution (selling).
	  <br><br>
	  Analyzing whale behavior is important because their movements often anticipate significant changes in Bitcoin’s price.

                <p>
                  They try to profit from changes in the price of bitcoin. If they believe the price will rise, they can take a long position. If they think the price will go down, they would take a short position.

                <strong>Hedging</strong>
                  <p>
                    Bitcoin miners and companies that rely on the price of bitcoin for their trading can use futures contracts to lock in a future price, protecting against price volatility.
