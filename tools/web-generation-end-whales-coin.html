          <h5>Bitcoin Whales Holdings (1000 to 10000 BTC)</h5>
        </a>
        <p> 
	  This chart shows the evolution of Bitcoin holdings in addresses that own between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, commonly referred to as *whales*. The blue line represents the total amount of bitcoins held by these addresses over time. The black line shows the price of Bitcoin during the same period.
	  <br><br>
	  At the bottom, the purple bar chart displays the daily bitcoin flow (inflows or outflows) for these addresses, expressed as a percentage. Positive values indicate accumulation (buying), while negative values indicate distribution (selling).
	  <br><br>
	  Analyzing whale behavior is important because their movements often anticipate significant changes in Bitcoinâ€™s price.

                <p>
                  They try to profit from changes in the price of bitcoin. If they believe the price will rise, they can take a long position. If they think the price will go down, they would take a short position.

                <strong>Hedging</strong>
                  <p>
                    Bitcoin miners and companies that rely on the price of bitcoin for their trading can use futures contracts to lock in a future price, protecting against price volatility.
